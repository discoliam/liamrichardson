<p class="Lede">Inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses/" target="_blank">Wes Bos</a> (as I found his resource very useful) this is a quick rundown of the things I use day to day for work / general messing around.</p>

## Editor + Terminal

I've been all in on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a few years now. I'm constatnly playing around with settings, but I'm pretty happy at the mo. I'm using [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) and the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) and [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) as a monospace font.

After experimenting with a few different terminals, I've switched back to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), but frankly, I normally use VScodes built-in terminal.

For my shell, I'm using [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/), again stealing [Wes's](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) setup, and I'm pretty happy with that.

I use [Amazon Q](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html) for code completion in the temrnal, somewhat by acident as they aquired [Fig](https://fig.io/). But, seems to work nicley.

## Desktop Apps

My go-to browser is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) these days. I quite like being the only person on a team with a different browser. Good for catching obscure bugs before/as/after they go live.

For design stuff, I'm now fully onboard the [Figma](https://www.figma.com) train. It's great, and I hope ~~Adobe~~ [they](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/) don't ruin it.

## Hardware

I have a [14 Inch Macbook Pro (2021)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-m1-pro-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-14-2021-specs.html). Having had an M2 Air for a short time for work, I don't think I'd buy a Pro model again. These M series chips are insane, and I don't think I've herd the fans once.

On my desk is a [Samsung 27" S80TB ViewFinity UHD Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/high-resolution/viewfinity-s8-27--27-inch-ips-uhd-thunderbolt-ls27b800tguxxu) which I managed to get for a steal from Costco. Its not perfect, but was over £1000 cheaper than the Apple Studio Display.

For input, I'm using the combo of a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-master-3) mouse and [Logitech MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard). I spent years on the Apple Magic Keyboard & Mouse, but I find my wrists less painful after a few days of hard work with these, which I attribute mostly to the mouse.

## Desk

My Desktop is a stupidly heavy bit of wood rescued from an office refurbishment job in Bristol. A friend saw a load of wood going in the bin, so just chucked it in his boot and gave me a call. For legs, I'm using [Flexispot EF1](https://flexispot.co.uk/electric-height-adjustable-standing-desk-e1.html) which I like, especially for the price.

I'm using [Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor Arms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jarvis-Monitor-Mounting-Computer-Displays/dp/B071G47JJG), with a laptop stand on one of the arms. I was lucky enough to be given this by a friend, and don't think I'll go back now.

To hide a few old drill holes I'm using a [Dotgrid Black deskmat](https://www.dotgrid.co/products/vegan-leather-desk-mat-black), mostly as it had a good review from [David Darnes](https://setups.co/posts/david-darnes).

My chair is a [Ikea LÅNGFJÄLL](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/langfjaell-conference-chair-gunnared-dark-grey-black-s99177641). Brought mostly because it was pretty cheap when we first moved back from Canada, it acctually suits me well.

## Audio

At home, I have a Numark tt-1700 turntable, which I was given by my step-brother. It's not my ideal turntable, but for now, it works. That's hooked up to a [ProJect Phono Box E](https://www.project-audio.com/en/product/phono-box-e/) phono stage. To switch between my laptop and the record player I use a [JDS Labs OL Switcher](https://jdslabs.com/product/ol-switcher/), which feeds into a set of [Kanto YU](https://www.kantoaudio.com/powered-speakers/yu/) powered speakers.

It's a small/cheap ish setup, which I'm planning on investing a bit more into over the next few years. A proper DAC is next on my shopping list, probably from [JDS Labs](https://jdslabs.com/), then maybe a [ProJect AUTOMAT A1](https://www.project-audio.com/en/product/a1/)

On the go, I'm using a pair of [Apple Airpods Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/). I can take or leave the noise cancellation and the price tag, but the seamless pairing/switching between my phone/laptop/iPad is hands down the best feature.

I've still got a pair of [Shure SE215s](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se215), but I mostly use these with the Playstation so as not to disturb others in the house.

## Gaming

My go-to console is a [PlayStation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps5/), but I only really play 3/4 games a year. I picked up a PS Plus account to play some classics on the cheap.

I keep thinking about a [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck), but not pulled the trigger just yet.

## Coffee

### Espresso

This was the big lockdown hobby that now dominates my life. After putting it off for a long time I ended up getting a good price on a [Gaggia Classic (2019)](https://www.gaggia.com/manual-machines/new-classic-evo/), which I've modded with a couple of accessions from [Shades of Coffee](https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/).

I pair this with a [Eureka Mignon Zero](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/catalogo/prodotti/macinacaff%C3%A8+on+demand/1/74.aspx) grinder, which doesn't look super pretty, but had good reviews and I'm happy with it. The dream is a [Niche Zero](https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/products/niche-zero), but Im hoping the release a flat burr version, or multi-purpose burrs for the [Duo](https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/products/niche-duo).

### Filter

For filter brewing, I use a [Hario V60](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/hario-v60-drip-decanter-pour-over-coffee-maker-700ml) or an [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/), which for both I have a variety of paper, metal, and cloth filters. When travelling, I'll normally carry a [MiiR Pourigami](https://www.miir.com/collections/pourigami-travel-coffee-system/products/pourigami-portable-travel-coffee-dripper).

I've brought into Fellow, picking up a [Stagg EKG](https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-ekg-electric-pour-over-kettle) Electric Kettle and [Tally™ Pro](https://fellowproducts.com/products/tally-coffee-scale) scales.

The coffee bar is getting a bit excessive, but maybe I'll pick up a [Clever Dripper](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/products/clever-coffee-dripper) and some sort of [Mokka Pot](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/shop/caffettiere/caffettiere.html) in the near future.

As for techniques/recepies/ratios, I'll do whatever [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) recommends.

## Other

- My phone is a [iPhone 16](https://www.apple.com/iphone-16/).

- I also have an [iPad Air M2](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-air/) which I mostly use for looking up recipes in the kitchen or watching movies on public transport.

- My daily backpack is a handmade Daysack by [Big Top](https://www.instagram.com/bigxtop/). It's fully waterproof (rain-wise), I've had it for 11 years and I imagine it'll last forever.
