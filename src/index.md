# Hi ðŸ‘‹

<p class="Lede"?>Hi, I'm <strong>Liam</strong>. Or, thanks to a misguided choice of nickname one summer when I was 12 years old, <em>DiscoLiam</em> ðŸª©.</p>

This is where I put some weird personal projects online. Nothing too exciting to be honest, but some of it didn't need to be on my work site.

I'm currently the Development Lead at [FutureKings](https://futurekings.co.uk).

If you're interested in my work ðŸ¤“, head on over to [discoliam.com](https://discoliam.com) which is the more professional though stupid-sounding business site. I've got this wrong somehow, haven't I?
