- I'm not doing well at keeping this weekly. Often I'm away or life gets in the way, and I've not got into a good flow of drafting them though the week.
- Spent the best part of the last two weeks in Tuscony for a wedding, then we stayed on in a villa for a few extra days since we're already there.
  - First time in Italy since Milan 2013 and the Grand Prix
  - Much less pizza was consumed this time around, but still, plenty was had
  - We had a lot of gelato
  - Managed to get a 1-day bike ride around the Tuscon hills on a Cannondale cross-country bike
  - First holiday in a while when I didnt take the laptop / do a mix of work and days off. Might try and do more of that in the future.
- I definetly find myself less intertested in TV these days. Theres loads of shows I'd normally watch I've yet to catch up on. Andor, The Last of Us, Black Mirror, Drive to Survive.
- Cycling continues, Brother in the Wild is only a few weeks away now. Hopefully, I'm ready for the "WTF" route, but we'll see.
