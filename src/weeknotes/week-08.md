- So I missed a week last week. I'll blame moving AirBnb's, exploring Cape Town and spending as much time as possible outside of work body boarding.
- We spent two weeks in Cape Town. It was lovley to be back. For a country that has some pretty serious soical, economic and saftey issues, it sure has some nice cities.
- On that note, seems every other "Digital Nomad" has found out about Cape Town, and short term rentals have destroyed the chance of local young people finding accomidation to either rent or buy. Consideing thats what we where doing, the guilt levels where pretty high. But, as we have family, I think we get a pass.
- Converting variable fonts isnt as straight forward as it sounds. Turns out most converters don't do a great job. But after a lot of trial and error, turns out Googles [woff2](https://github.com/google/woff2) tool does a good job, and [Yabe Webfont](https://webfont.yabe.land/en/misc/convert-ttf-woff2/) are hosting a version for your convenience.
- Luckily Mia [saved the day](https://front-end.social/@mia/114078742725928092) with VS Code's [SVG Preview update](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_97#_svg-image-preview-support).
