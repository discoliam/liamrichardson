I've decided to start writing weeknotes. I've thoroughly enjoyed reading my friend [Jordan's](https://weeknotes.elver.me/) for the better part of 3 years. Hopefully it helps focus some wondering thoughts, but we'll see. I expect the format will change.

- I was thinking about starting this on 1st Jan, but I ended up waiting until the first full week of 2025 to post. Well-thought-out planning or a plot device to buy time?
- We saw [Nosferatu](https://letterboxd.com/discoliam/film/nosferatu-2024/). Really liked it. Not as mad as The Northman (which was a bit all over the place tbf) but enjoyed it.
- In November I decided to take a [full-time job](https://futurekings.co.uk/) again (hello future mortgage ðŸ‘‹). Apart from an _interesting_ start, I'm really excited about the new year and plans we have as a business. Hopefully good times ahead.
- We continue planning/booking our trip to Kenya and South Africa. I think I've ordered all the safari clothes I need. Now, I just need to hope I won't get Malaria or African sleeping sickness.
- On the holiday front, I'm toying with buying a camera again. But a decent mirrorless and zoom lense is still going to set me back the best part of Â£800, even second hand.
- [Mantracks](https://youtu.be/2UDXdqqJQPE?si=Hvr8m5iBMXliWWyV), the new Folding Ideas video is outâ€”amazing stuff as always. Creationists be crazy.
