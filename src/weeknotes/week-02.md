- This week, we attended the [Bristol Comedy Festival](https://thebristolcomedyfestival.com/). We saw [Glenn Moore](https://www.glennmoorecomedy.com/) on Monday and [Mark Watson](https://www.markwatsonthecomedian.com/) on Friday, and both were excellent. I enjoy WIP shows in smaller venues, probably more than tour shows. I suspect not what comedians really want to hear.
- After just looking up their respective websites, I feel there's a market for decent websites for performers. Essentially Squarespace/Webflow/Myspace but decent SEO, links to relevant platforms, ability to list gigs and tours. The side project list is ever-growing.
- We also went to the [Barley Wood Wassail](https://www.barleywoodcider.com/wassail) on Saturday. Luckily there was some mulled apple juice at the bar to keep warm and alcohol-free at the same time. The Wassail was great. It was basically a Pagan bonfire night but was more cider-focused. Singing to the trees, crowning a Wassail King and Queen, and some questionable health and safety policies around the ring of fire. Lovely stuff.
- I've ended up becoming the SEO/Social Media/Marketing guru at work, somehow. Anyway, it's been interesting implementing some of my initial plans, but I've got a lot more to learn. The number of different tools Google supplies marketers with is wild, and half of them don't even talk to each other. Google Business Profiles don't even have an admin. The official way to log in is just to google your business name. Insane.
- The new [brand](https://brand.dropbox.com/) site from DropBox is really nice, and even built on [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). I wonder how much of it is custom, and did Webflow helped or hindered this process.
- Exercise-wise, a couple of little bike rides (10km, 27km and 40km respectively) this week. Ideally, I should get out and do something closer to 60/80 km, but struggling to find the time this side of the Holiday.
- I also need to find some more routes out of Bristol for bike rides. North Somerset is lovely, but I've been through a lot of it now.
