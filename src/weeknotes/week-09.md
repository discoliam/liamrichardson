- Discovered [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) this week. Luckily they had my font of choice ([Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)) patched and ready to go.
- This lead me into a rabbit warren of thinking about my shell. After flirting with [Starship](https://starship.rs/), I ended up settling on using [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), which at least felt familiar to [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/).
  - For a config, I ended up making [my own](https://github.com/discoliam/dotfiles/blob/main/.omp.discoliam.json) but used [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/oh-my-posh) as a starting point.
- Whilst on this setup upbender, I started thinking about browsers. Though I've been a happy Firefox user for years, a recent [terms of use snafu](https://www.theverge.com/news/622080/mozilla-revising-firefox-terms-of-use-data) has made me rethink. I tried [Arc](https://arc.net/) for a few days, but I didn't get on with it. Crucially, I need a long address bar, but you can only get that with Dev mode in Arc. But, you can't blanket make all websites open in Dev mode, so it's back to the drawing board on that one.
- Finally, I re-opened [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), and moved my VS Code setup across after the auto setup failed last time. I've used up my auto-complete credits, but the generated code seems good so far. More investigation is required, but so far so good.
- No, I haven't updated my /uses page yet. Soon I promise.
