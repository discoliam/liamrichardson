- Attempted my first "[Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)" work this week, a term I only heard via LinkedIn on Monday.
  - The first was a shaky mouse interaction thing on a grid of images. It took a few attempts, but eventually it got to where I wanted. Also saved me working out some deltas and basic trigonometry, so I was happy with that.
  - The second attempt was much simpler. Just fading in and out some text and images. Something easy enough to write my self, but I couldn't be bothered. Interestingly, it gave ti to me as a React Component with out my asking. I guess its mostly trained on React projects. Anyway, when I asked for it in Vanilla JS, it did what I asked.
  - I need to learn how to integrate it more into my current active project. This ended up sticking random HTML files all over a WordPress theme, which obviously wasn't going to work.
- Used up some of my "free" tickets from the [Everyman membership](https://www.everymancinema.com/membership/) to watch [Black Bag](https://letterboxd.com/discoliam/film/black-bag-2025/). Enjoyed it.
- As it was unusually warm on the spring equinox, I went camping!
  - I decided to Bivy in some woods about 40mins cycle from home. Was a bit weird just sleeping out in the woods, but with a fire and some podcasts for company, it was a comfortable night.
  - I think a 1 man tent would let me sleep better if I was by myself again, but as a group I think the [Bivy Bag](https://alpkit.com/products/hunka-xl) worked well on a dry night. Not sure I'd do it in the rain.
  - I think I was most uncomfortable about being discovered by another person. Its hard to get remote near a city. But I didn't see anyone, and left just as the first dog walker appeared in the morning.
  - It wasn't the greatest night sleep, but I'm glad I did it. If it warms up soon, I'll try again I think.
- Finally brought a new bike stem and re-wrapped my bars since the tape came off and I bent my shifter in December. Nice to have some straight brakes again. Bike riding was uninspired this week. But, keen to get on it again this week, as [BITW](https://www.brothercycles.com/2024/11/brother-in-the-wild-dorset-25-tickets-coming-soon/#tickets) is fast approaching and I am not fit enough
- On that front, I picked up [Gravel Rides South West England](https://www.adventurebooks.com/products/gravel-rides-south-west-england). Only skimmed so far, but looks like some good rides to start ticking off.
- Today is the 5 year anniversary of being laid of thanks to Covid. It was an up and down job, but I do miss some of the friends I made there I've lost touch with since we left Canada.
