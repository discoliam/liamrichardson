- Week 3 and I'm already late. Nevermind.
  It's been a busy week. Work is super busy as I wind down for my Holiday, and getting ready for said holiday is taking up most of the spare time.
- I keep looking at [View Transtion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) demos in Firefox and [remembering why](https://caniuse.com/view-transitions) I havn't learnt them yet.
- But on that note, [Container Queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) seem to be solid for a year. Probably worth diving into them now.
- [Make Deafheaven Black Metal again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h_WVPSoMwU)â€”I actually really liked the 'pop' album. This sounds a bit more like "New Bermuda", which is maybe my least favourite record by them. But I'll probably hunt down a limited pressing of this when some come to the UK.
- Saw [A Complate Unknown](https://letterboxd.com/discoliam/film/a-complete-unknown/) and rather enjoyed it. Though, typically the move the infamous ["Judas!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViHf4fABxI) moment from Manchester Free Trade Hall to Newport Folk Festival. It made sense story-wise, but me and a couple of others in the cinema openly tutted.
