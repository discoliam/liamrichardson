- Two weeks on safari was probably enough / too much? But, we had a great time.
- We ended with 3 nights in [Watamu](https://charlies-travels.com/en/watamu-the-little-italy-of-kenya/), a small beach resort town run by Italians. We found the whole place a bit overwhelming and ended up hiding in the resort or on the quiet beach. We did find a little woman-owned restaurant/cafe we visited a few times, much nicer than the tourist traps along the beaches.
- [David](https://dbushell.com/notes/2025-02-13T07:08Z/) pointed out that someone was claiming to come up with the term "Hero" for the above-the-fold parts of websites. I mean, check there isn't obvious proof your claim is false on the first page of Google. Looks like Smashing Magazine took the [article down](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/02/popular-wordpress-theme-term-hero-section/) at least.
- After two epic days of Travel via Taxi/Train/Taxi/Shuttle/Plane/Taxi we made it to Cape Town. It's nice to be back.
- Spent a lovely Sunday evening with friends old and new in Cape Point Vineyards for a picnic at sunset.
- My first day back at work tomorrow...
