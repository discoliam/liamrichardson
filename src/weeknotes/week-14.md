- I have no good excuses for missing the past few weeks. I've been away a bit, but mostly come Sunday night, I just can't be bothered. I need to get better at keeping notes during the week. Maybe I should sync the build to some notes app on my phone/laptop or something like that.
- I spent a week working remotely in rural Devon. I like being down there, but it is remote. The house we dog-sit for is a concerted barn. It's lovely, but you can't even go for a walk from the house, which gets to me after a few days.
- I think I need a side project for learning new stuff.
- Even the most anti-AI people I know are now paying for [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/pricing). I think I'm going to have to dive in. I have found the tooling I'm doing with it to be a pretty helpful learning tool.
- But also, [Shopify in being awful again shocker](https://www.theverge.com/news/644943/shopify-ceo-memo-ai-hires-job)
- Chrome redundancies this week. Bit of a shocker that one, but there seems to be more talk about Google selling it off to keep the EU happy.
- Sidenote, I've noticed Firefox just being a bit more rubbish recently. Didnt, find an alternative browser in the end, but seriously considering trying Edge for a week...
- ["Tailwindâ€™s @apply Feature is Better Than it Sounds "](https://css-tricks.com/tailwinds-apply-feature-is-better-than-it-sounds/) - I sort of agree with this, though I rarely use Tailwind anymore, it did remind me of [Adams distain](https://nitter.net/adamwathan/status/15592504035476520977) of said feature.
- Took me a while to remember [Nitter](https://nitter.net/) for that last link. It was the final nail in the coffin, and I deleted my Twitter account. I've got my backup if I ever want to dive though. I've not done a "proper" tweet in well over 5 years, and it's been closer to 10 since I was properly "active". Kinda sad really. Some of the early 2000's tech seemed so exciting.
- It was [Record Store Day](https://www.recordstoreday.co.uk/) yesterday, another thing I used to love that's gone downhill. But I've supported my [local record shop](https://specialistsubjectrecords.co.uk) a couple of times in the last 2 weeks.
  - [Deafheaven](https://specialistsubjectrecords.co.uk/products/deafheaven-lonely-people-with-power-2xlp-cd?_pos=1&_sid=ac2256ceb&_ss=r) record is great
  - I like the [Scowl](https://specialistsubjectrecords.co.uk/products/scowl-are-we-all-angels-lp?_pos=1&_sid=24a6c1827&_ss=r) record way more than I thought I would
  - Pre-ordered the new [Turnstile](https://specialistsubjectrecords.co.uk/products/turnstile-never-enough-lp?_pos=1&_sid=eefd7f16b&_ss=r) records.
