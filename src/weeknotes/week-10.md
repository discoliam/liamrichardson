- Experimenting with cursor more this week. Need to get into it more, but so far haven't felt the need to open VS Code.
- This is the first post written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'm not sure its the Markdown editor I want, but we'll try it for a few weeks. No official Grammarly support, maybe I just need a spell-check plugin for Cursor.
