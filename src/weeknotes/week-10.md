- Experimenting with cursor more this week. Need to get into it more, but so far haven't felt the need to open VS Code.
- This is the first post written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'm not sure its the Markdown editor I want, but we'll try it for a few weeks. No official Grammarly support, maybe I just need a spell-check plugin for Cursor.
- ["# OpenAI Calls on U.S. Government to Let It Freely Use Copyrighted Material for AI Training"](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/openai-copyrighted-material/) - Fuck Off
- I'm [11ty Certified](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/certification/) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamrichardson/)
- ["Reshape Your Instagram With a Recommendations Reset "](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram/) - Interesting.
- Was trying to use the native CSS scrollbar styling this week in production. Browser support is [all good ](https://caniuse.com/css-scrollbar), but my default Mac setting is "Show Scrollbars automatically based on mouse or trackpad" - which basically means it only shows up when scrolled. This rendered our horizontal card scroller give or take useless. We've ended up resorting to a JS based carousel with pagination and buttons. Maybe thats the better UX decision anyway.
- Finally got [drafts](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config-preprocessors/#example-drafts) working porperly on this here week notes section.
- Yes I updated my [/uses](https://liamrichardson.co.uk/uses) page after last weeks updates. No changes to setup so far this week.
