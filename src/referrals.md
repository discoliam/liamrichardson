I use a lot of services that often offer referral codes. If you end up signing up for a similar service, use the links below and we'll both get money off. To quote an animated meerkat, simples.

## Freeagent

The premier accounting software. I don't use half of the features, and still think its incredible value for money. Sign up using the link below and we both get **10% off**.

## DNSimple

More often than not, CNAMEs, A Records, and everything else confuses the hell out of me. DNSimple made it super easy, and it is pretty cheap given its power. Sign up using the link below and we both get **$5 credit**.

## ExpressVPN

Privacy is important. As is freedom. Netflix is better in other countries too. When I need a VPN if using public wifi etc, I use ExpressVPN. Signup using the button and you'll get **30 free days**, and I think I do too.

## Bower Collective

Bower was the perfect client, and since meeting them I've become a loyal customer. Being as envirometnally friendly as possible is really hard, and Bower is on a misson to make it as simple as possible. Shop using the link bellow and we both get **Â£15 off**.
